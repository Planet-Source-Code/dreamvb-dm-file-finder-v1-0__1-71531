DM FileFinder

DM FileFinder is a simple basic tool for seraching for files, I made this
Becuase I did not like the Windows Vista new Serach features and wanted
something simple and basic to use.
As I say it very basic it can at the moment serach by file name or patten eg *.exe

I also included Folder.reg this is if you want to add seraching to the right 
click of folders Note you will of cause have to chnage the file path.
hope you like it
